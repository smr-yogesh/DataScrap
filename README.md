## Use this app and data provided by this app for experimental purposes only. Please do trade or ask anyone to trade based on the data this app provides. as it fatches data from 3rd party site, the data is enough late to make an bad trade decision.


This is simple python program powered by Pandas to scrap data fom web.
This Program fetches data from 'https://www.nepalipaisa.com/StockLive.aspx' and stores information into json file.
After json is created it reads that file and shows in localhost as table data.
NOTE:- FOR FIRST TIME PLEASE START FROM RUNNING AUTOMATE.PY FIRST. 

You may ask why it does not directly takes data and shows in localhost as table data, its because i wanted and it includes several functions and i get better at them.
and again that json file can be used to make own api aswell. ANd this program returns api aswell at "/api".
