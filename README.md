# DataScrap
This is simple python program powered by Pandas to scrap data fom web.
This Program fetches data from 'https://www.nepalipaisa.com/StockLive.aspx' and stores information into json file.
After json is created it reads that file and shows in localhost as table data.

You may ask why it does not directly takes data and shows in localhost as table data, its because i wanted and it includes several functions and i get better at them.
and again that json file can be used to make own api aswell.
